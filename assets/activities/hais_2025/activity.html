I had the opportunity to <strong>present our work “Perplexity, Uncertainty, and the Limits of Active Learning”</strong> at the <strong>20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025)</strong>, held in Salamanca, Spain. The presentation sparked insightful discussions around the challenges of <strong>Active Learning with Large Language Models</strong> and how dataset complexity—particularly in terms of <em>perplexity</em> and <em>uncertainty</em>—influences performance and generalization.

Sharing our findings with the research community allowed me to <strong>exchange ideas with experts in NLP and hybrid AI systems</strong>, gaining valuable feedback on potential directions for improving Active Learning robustness. The session emphasized the growing interest in <strong>data-efficient LLM training</strong> and reinforced the importance of exploring new hybrid and uncertainty-aware query strategies.

Participating in HAIS 2025 was a rewarding experience that not only highlighted the relevance of our research within the AI community but also strengthened collaborations for <strong>future work on adaptable and trustworthy learning systems</strong>.
